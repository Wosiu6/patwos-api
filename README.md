# Patwos API

A Go-based REST API with user authentication and comment management functionality, designed to work with Traefik and Docker to support my personal website/blog.

## Disclaimer
This is by no means api for only my page, anyone could adapt and use it. I will make the name more generic after i'm done implementing everything i wanted. Might make it more generic at one point and publish separately.
